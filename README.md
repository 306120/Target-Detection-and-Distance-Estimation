# Target-Detection-and-Distance-Estimation
The current code is related to The Visual Computer journal. The Target Detection and Distance Estimation modules are implemented within the ultralytics-Main codebase and can be adapted based on the specific object detection model used. Before any improvements were made, we utilized the YOLOv8n model as the baseline. The CMM-YOLOv8 model is included in the yolov8v10-main-20240609 codebase, where we replaced the loss function with MPDIoU and used the configuration file yolov8-c2f-faster-MSDA.yaml for training and evaluation.
