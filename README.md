# Target-Detection-and-Distance-Estimation
The Target Detection and Distance Estimation module is located in the main code package and can be adapted to different object detection models as needed. Before improving the detection model, we used YOLOv8n as the baseline. The improved CMM-YOLOv8 model is included in the yolov8v10-main-20240609 package, and the version integrated with the MPDIoU loss function is configured to run using the yolov8-c2f-Faster-MSDA.yaml file.
